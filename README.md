# Faster New File And Folder

VSCode extension for faster file and folder creation.

## Features

By default, VSCode only allows you to create file and folder only if the source being right clicked is a folder. This extension enables you to create them even if the source is a file. The newly created file and folder will appear the same path level as the source file.
